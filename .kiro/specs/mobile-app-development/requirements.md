# Requirements Document

## Introduction

EcoConnect currently exists as a Next.js web application with AI-powered waste detection, gamification, and vendor mapping features. To maximize user engagement and accessibility, especially in India's mobile-first market, the platform needs a comprehensive mobile application that provides offline capabilities, enhanced camera integration, and location-based services. This mobile app will complement the existing web platform while providing native mobile experiences that are crucial for widespread adoption in the sustainability space.

## Requirements
